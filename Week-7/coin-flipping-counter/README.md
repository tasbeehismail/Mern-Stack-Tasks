# Coin Flipping Counter

This is a simple React app that simulates a coin flip. Every time the user clicks the "Flip Coin" button, the app will flip the coin and keep track of how many times heads and tails have appeared.

## Features:
- Flip the coin by clicking a button.
- Track the number of heads and tails.
- Display a random result of either heads or tails after each flip.
